    ForeignKey relation field.

    This field represents a foreign key relation to another model.

    See :ref:`foreign_key` for usage information.

    You must provide the following:

    ``model_name``:
        The name of the related model in a :samp:`'{app}.{model}'` format.

    The following is optional:

    ``related_name``:
        The attribute name on the related model to reverse resolve the foreign key.
    ``on_delete``:
        One of:
            ``field.CASCADE``:
                Indicate that the model should be cascade deleted if related model gets deleted.
            ``field.RESTRICT``:
                Indicate that the related model delete will be restricted as long as a
                foreign key points to it.
            ``field.SET_NULL``:
                Resets the field to NULL in case the related model gets deleted.
                Can only be set if field has ``null=True`` set.
            ``field.SET_DEFAULT``:
                Resets the field to ``default`` value in case the related model gets deleted.
                Can only be set is field has a ``default`` set.
            ``field.NO_ACTION``:
                Take no action.
    ``to_field``:
        The attribute name on the related model to establish foreign key relationship.
        If not set, pk is used
    ``db_constraint``:
        Controls whether or not a constraint should be created in the database for this foreign key.
        The default is True, and thatâ€™s almost certainly what you want; setting this to False can be very bad for data integrity.
